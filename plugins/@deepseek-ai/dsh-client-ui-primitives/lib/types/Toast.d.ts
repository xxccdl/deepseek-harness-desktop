/**
 * Transient top-center banner: slides in, holds at full opacity, fades out,
 * then reports done so the owner can unmount it. Re-showing the same text
 * restarts the cycle when the owner remounts the component (key it by a
 * per-show sequence). Rendered through a body portal so an owner inside a
 * transformed or filtered ancestor cannot trap the fixed banner in that
 * ancestor's box.
 * With unchanged holdMs, parent rerenders do not extend the lifetime.
 * Completion calls the latest onDone handler; fully faded actions receive no input.
 *
 * The hold is the owner's to set, because how long a banner has to stay
 * depends on how much there is to read: a one-line limit lands in the default
 * window, while a failure that names what broke does not. One value drives
 * both the unmount timer and the stylesheet's fade delay — the stylesheet
 * reads it as a custom property — so the two can no longer disagree and leave
 * the banner unmounting mid-fade.
 * @param props.text - resolved banner copy; the owner passes localized text.
 * @param props.icon - optional leading glyph (e.g. a warning icon); ignored
 * under `tone="success"`, which brings its own glyph.
 * @param props.tone - 'success' renders the design's circled green check as
 * the leading glyph; omitted, the icon seat keeps its warning tint.
 * @param props.actions - optional inline actions continuing the sentence:
 * each renders its plain-text `prefix` (a connective like 或) followed by its
 * localized `label` as blue clickable text, flowing after `text` as one
 * sentence. Each press is the owner's to handle (e.g. undo the reported
 * change, then unmount the toast). The banner surface stays click-through —
 * only the action text takes the pointer.
 * @param props.holdMs - full-opacity hold before the fade; defaults to 3000.
 * @param props.anchor - optional element whose horizontal center the banner
 * follows (e.g. the composer card, so the banner centers over the chat column
 * rather than the whole window); omitted, it centers on the viewport.
 * @param props.onDone - called once the fade completes; unmount the toast here.
 * @returns the floating banner.
