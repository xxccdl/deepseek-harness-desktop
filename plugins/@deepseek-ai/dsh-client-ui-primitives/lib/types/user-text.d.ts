/**
 * Display projection of reference forms in sent user text (bubble and queue
 * rows). The logged model text remains the single truth; this is presentation
 * only, and every part renders inline so a single-line message never breaks
 * across lines. Four decoration sources, by precedence: the wire session form
 * `@[label](dsh-session:...)` folds to its label; exact session labels
 * supplied by an adjacent recall decorate their bare `@label` mention; plain
 * `@name` word-boundary tokens decorate by shape alone; and a plain `/name`
 * token decorates only when the caller names it — a skill the host actually
 * loaded for that message (ui-chat reads the step's `skill-invocation`
 * injections) or the command a command-input bubble echoes — so `/123` or a
 * stray `/word` stays plain text. A `/name` token is whitespace-bounded like
 * the host skill gesture (`dsh-tool-skill`): it ends at whitespace or the
 * text end, so slash paths (`/nfs-hg/xxx`, `/plan.md`) and punctuation-glued
 * tokens (`/plan。`) stay plain even for a loaded name.
